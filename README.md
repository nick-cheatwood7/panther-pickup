- If you are new to Markdown or simply need a refresher, check out GitHub's [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- If you are using Visual Studio Code (recommended) as your IDE, here are a few Extensions to check out:
  - [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare): Live Share allows us to collaborate with the codebase in Real time. This is crucial for testing and peer-programming.
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Although perhaps more trivial than the other extensions listed, Prettier is an industry standard for enforcing clean code. Prettier does menial tasks, such as auto-indenting, adding semicolons, etc. that helps keep your code clean and easily readable.
  - [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag): Auto Close Tag, as the name implies, auto-closes your syntax tags. Like Prettier, this saves you small steps along the way, but helps you focus on what really mattersâ€“ writing code.
